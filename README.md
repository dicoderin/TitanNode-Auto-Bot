## ‚ú® Features

- **Full Automation**: Just run it, and the bot will handle the rest.
- **Token Management**: Automatically refreshes the access token to keep the session active.
- **Proxy Support**: Run multiple bots simultaneously using a proxy list from `proxies.txt`.
- **Direct Mode**: If no proxies are provided, the bot will run using your main internet connection.
- **Secure**: Safely stores your refresh token in a `.env` file.
- **Random User-Agent**: Uses a random user-agent for each connection to appear more natural.

## üîß Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to complete the following configuration:

### 1. Refresh Token (`.env`)

1.  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open the `.env` file and enter your `REFRESH_TOKEN`.
    ```env
    # Replace with your refresh token
    REFRESH_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
    ```
    > **How to get `REFRESH_TOKEN`**: Log in to the [Titan Dashboard](https://edge.titannet.info/signup?inviteCode=X3X2TJ3A), open Developer Tools (F12) -> Application -> Local Storage, find `titan-edge-user-info`, and copy the value from `refresh_token`.

### 2. Proxies (`proxies.txt`) - Optional

If you want to use proxies:

1.  Create a `proxies.txt` file in the main directory.
2.  Enter your proxy list, one proxy per line. The bot will create a connection for each proxy listed.
    ```txt
    # Format: http://[user:password@]host:port
    [http://user1:pass1@proxy1.com:8080](http://user1:pass1@proxy1.com:8080)
    [http://user2:pass2@proxy2.com:8080](http://user2:pass2@proxy2.com:8080)
    socks5://user3:pass3@proxy3.com:1080
    ```
    If the `proxies.txt` file is empty or does not exist, the bot will run in direct mode (without proxies).

## üöÄ Running the Bot

After the configuration is complete, run the bot with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will start the connection, display the status, and begin collecting points for you.
